# ArduinoTH
Data Acquisition System prototype for temperature and humidity data collecting and calculation of dew point and heat index.

This code is result of a project for my [Master degree in Applied Computing][1]  at [State University of Feira de Santana (UEFS)][2]
Advisor: Gracinete Bastos de Souza <graciesouza (at) gmail (dot) com>

This prototype uses Adafruit DHT11 sensor to achieve the proposed goal.
To run this code, install [DHT library][3] sensor from Arduino Library Manager.
